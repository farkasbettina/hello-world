    "This assignment asks you to study competition in local markets of the Ready-Mix Concrete Manufacturing industry ([NAICS 327320](https://www.census.gov/econ/isp/sampler.php?naicscode=327320&naicslevel=6)). To this end, you can use the script below to estimate a simple version of [Abbring, Campbell, Tilly and Yang's (2017)](https://edubb.uvt.nl/bbcswebdav/pid-1678085-dt-content-rid-5981553_1/courses/325134-2017-2018/acty1b.pdf) dynamic model of oligopolistic entry, competition, and exit, using data from the U.S. Census Bureau. See e.g. the work of Chad Syverson and that of Allan Collard-Wexler for more information about and economic analyses of the Ready-Mix Concrete Manufacturing industry."

    "The estimated values of coefficients obtained are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\mu_{C}*10^{2}=0.34$, which refers to the mean of demand growth on the market. This result can be interpreted the following way: on average the population, which represents the demand on the market, growth by 0.34% annually.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\sigma_C*10^2=1.12$, providing the variance of the demand growth, i.e. growth of population on the market. From this we can conclude that the growth of population is rather unstable due to a high standard deviation comparing to an average annual growth. This is in line with the findings of Allan Collard-Wexler(https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.3982/ECTA6877), who noted that since the size of the local construction industry fluctuates by an average of 30%per year,the ready-mix concrete industry experiences large changes in demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\phi=27.72$, the parameter of the sunk costs to entry $\\phi e^{W_t}$. This can be interpreted in comparance to the costs of staying on the market. As the entry costs is almost 28 times higher comparing to the staying costs, that means that we can expect that companies would 'enter' the market for a relatively long period due to the fact that high entry costs make it unprofitable to enter market and leave soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\omega=1.59$, the scale parameter of log-normal distribution of exponent of the costs shock $W_t$, which gives the idea about the level of variance of the costs shock.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $k_1*10^4=0.38$. In order to find out the interpretation of this parameter, minor transformation should be conducted. Thus, $\\frac{1}{k_1*10^3}=\\frac{1}{0.038}=26.3$. This means that 26.3 thousand population would ensure zero surplus for a monopolist on the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $k_2*10^4=0.26$. This coefficient is respective to the previous one but for 2 companies on the market. However, the transformation and consequently, interpretation, whould be slightly different. In particular,  $\\frac{k_2}{k_1}=\\frac{0.26}{0.38}=0.684$. From here we could conclude that if on the monopolistic market one more company appears, it reduces the expected surplus by almost 32%\n",
    "\n",
    "- $k_3*10^4=0.22$. Similiarly, the following parameter can be interpreted: $\\frac{k_3}{k_2}=\\frac{0.22}{0.26}=0.846$. Thus, if one more company enters the market with two companies, it reduces the expected surplus by almost around 15.4%.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $k_4*10^4=0.17$. Finally: $\\frac{k_4}{k_3}=\\frac{0.17}{0.22}=0.773$. Thus, if one more company enters the market with three companies, and the number of companies reaches the maximum possible value, it reduces the expected surplus by almost around 23%\n",
    "\n",
    "It should also be noted that the obtained results stay in line with what we would expect for $k_i$ parameters according to the existing literature. In particular, it can be noted that the speed of surplus reduction is decreasing with each additional compamy entering the market. It can be explained by the establishment of a highly competitive market, resulting from the high substituability of the product between producers.\n"
